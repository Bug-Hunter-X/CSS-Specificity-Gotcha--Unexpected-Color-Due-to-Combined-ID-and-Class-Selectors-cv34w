The solution involves understanding and properly managing CSS specificity.  Here's a revised CSS approach:

```css
/* solution.css */
#myElement {
  color: blue; /*This selector should be enough to solve the issue*/
}

.myElement {
  color: red; /*This rule won't apply anymore because the #myElement selector is more specific*/
}

/* The combined selector is unnecessary and can be removed */
/* #myElement.myElement {
  color: green;
} */
```

By understanding and resolving CSS Specificity issues, we ensure that the styles are applied correctly, avoiding unexpected behavior and simplifying maintainability.
